//This project is my first time creating something at this scale.

//This is an app created to monitor a hydroponics system with Arduino sensors.

//This was part of the BTEC Level 3 (Unit 17 - Mobile App Development) Computer Science course,
//where are task was to evaluate app designs and then design and create an app that connected to
//an IOT system based off the evaluations that we had made.

//While this project was fun. Most likely it will have been left in an unfinished state,
//due to me needing to prioritise the other A-levels and focus on the exams that come with them.

//By leaving the project unfinished, I mean that the functionality in the four main pages of the app 
//(MainPage, Humidity, Temperature and WaterLevel) do work as intended. It is just that (most likely)
//the settings of the app would not have any effect of the app.

//So by focusing on my A-levels, which are in 7 weeks from the time that I wrote this, I hope that one day
//I can come back to this code and finally implement an functioning settings page.
//If not I will take the lessons that I have learnt creating this .NET MAUI app and implementing the
//knowledge I have gained to create my own game to be available on mobile devices.

//If you have read this far, there is a very 'humble' credits page easter egg, if you tap on the the bottom/
//middle part of the screen. Layoutbounds were used so it might be in a different position based
//on screen size.
